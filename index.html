        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Software Sevelopmeant was never something I thought I would be doing
            until one day a friend of mine was playing around with JavaScript and it looked
            cool. From that day Ive tried to learn as much as I can on my own then 
            realized some help would be nice. Its confusing and rewarding at the same time and though my 
            work isnt the craziest its cool to see how much can be done with some simple code.
